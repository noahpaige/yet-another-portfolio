maybe i can call it the PIMP method? need to think of what each letter stands for.
P: Planning
I: Implementation
M: ?
P: ? something to do with documentation

I've developed a specific method for vibe coding that I want to share! This method is primarily designed for projects with a single developer, but I'm sure there are some lessons that can be applied to larger teams.

Planning

Here's how I craft my initial prompt:

- Tell the AI to not write code yet. You need to be very clear about this requirement for the prompt. This is especially important for tools like Cursor that can write code without asking.
- Define the task with as much detail as possible.
  - Questions like:
    - Should it use a specific library?
    - Should it integrate with any existing code?
- Define the scope
  - this is important! In my experience, AI tools have a tendency to choose overly complex solutions to simple problems.
- Tell it to create a step-by-step implementation plan.

Once you've sent the prompt, it's time to review. Take your time and read through each step. You'll probably find a few issues with the plan. Go ahead ask the AI to correct the plan. Keep repeating until you're happy with the plan.

Documentation

Once you finish planning, it's time to document the plan. You need to document the plan because it makes it easier for you and the AI to review the plan later on. This is especially true if/when you want to start a new conversation thread with the AI.

In my projects, I like to create a documentation/ folder to put all my markdown documetation in. This is where I put my plans, too. Once I save my plan document \<feature name\>-plan.md, I also immediately create a \<feature name\>-implementation.md file. This second document is where we are going to have the AI document what we actually implemented after each step. Implementations rarely go to exactly to plan, so we have to keep track of what we actually implemented.

Go ahead and commit the plan docs to your repo. Personally, I like to create a new branch for each feature.

Implementation
Now, it's time to implement. Go ahead and ask the AI to implement the first step. If you're starting in a new conversation thread, then you'll need to point the AI to the planning doc.

You'll need to monitor the AI's progress while it's implementing in case of unexpected issues, or problems with the plan.

Once the AI is finished and you're happy with the implementation, we have more documentation to do! Now, tell the AI to document the actual implementation in \<feature name\>-implementation.md. Once it's finished, go ahead and commit the implementation doc to your repo.

Repeat these steps until you've implemented the entire feature.

Documentation (again)
Nice job! You just vibe coded a whole feature! Now, it's time to document the feature.

First, make sure that you've filled out each step in the \<feature name\>-implementation.md file with the actual implementation. Next, we'll prompt the AI to document the feature. Point it towards your \<feature name\>-plan.md and \<feature name\>-implementation.md files and ask it to write a separate feature document.

Why do we create a **third** documentation file? Because you're probably going to implement some more features, and we both know you don't know how to explain how all the code you just vibe coded works! We create this third file so we can reference it with the AI in the future.

Here are some use cases for the third documentation file:

- You're working on a new feature, and you need it to integrate with some existing code (that you vibe coded). Just tell the AI to read the feature document, and BOOM! It will immediately be an expert without having to analyze your whole codebase.
- You're debugging something, and you have no idea how the code works! Just ask the AI your specific question, and reference the feature document to help it answer your question.
- If you're working with a team, you can use the feature document to help the team understand the code you vibe coded.
