I've developed a specific method for AI-assisted development that I want to share! This method is primarily designed for projects with a single developer, but I'm sure there are some lessons that can be applied to larger teams. I call it the **PIPE Method** - **P**lanning, **I**mplementation, **P**rogress tracking, and **E**valuation.

###

The PIPE Method Overview

The PIPE Method is a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that ensures you maintain control while leveraging AI's capabilities effectively. Here's what each phase entails:

- [**Planning**](#phase-1-planning): Create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan
- [**Implementation**](#phase-2-implementation): Execute the plan with AI assistance
- [**Progress Tracking**](#phase-3-progress-tracking): Document what was actually implemented
- [**Evaluation**](#phase-4-evaluation): Create comprehensive feature documentation

## Phase 1: Planning

The foundation of successful AI-assisted development is thorough planning. Here's how I craft my initial prompt:

- **Explicitly tell the AI not to write code yet** - This is crucial, especially for tools like Cursor that can generate code automatically
- **Define the task with maximum detail**:
  - Should it use specific libraries or frameworks?
  - How should it integrate with existing code?
  - What are the performance requirements?
- **Define clear scope boundaries** - AI tools often over-engineer solutions, so be explicit about what you want
- **Request a step-by-step implementation plan**
  - This breaks the problem down the work into manageable chunks
  - This is important! We'll be referencing this plan continuously throughout the implementation process

### Review and Refine

Once you receive the initial plan:

1. **Read through each step carefully**
2. **Identify potential issues or gaps**
3. **Ask the AI to correct and improve the plan**
4. **Repeat until you're satisfied with the approach**

### The Implementation Plan Document

Once you're happy with your plan, it's time to document it:

1. **Create a `documentation/` folder** in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. **Save your plan as `<feature-name>-plan.md`** - Use a descriptive name like `user-authentication-plan.md`
3. **Include the complete planning conversation** - Copy the final, refined plan from your AI conversation
4. **Add any additional context** - Notes about design decisions, constraints, or assumptions
5. **Commit the plan document** - This creates a baseline for your implementation

**Pro tip**: I like to create a new git branch for each feature at this point. This keeps your planning work separate and makes it easy to reference later.

## Phase 2: Implementation

Now, it's time to implement. Here's my implementation workflow:

### Starting Implementation

- Ask the AI to implement the first step of your plan
- If starting a new conversation thread, reference your planning document
- Monitor the AI's progress for unexpected issues or plan deviations

Once the AI is finished and you're happy with the implementation, we have more documentation to do! Implementations rarely go exactly to plan, so we have to keep track of what we actually implemented. Ask the AI to document the actual implementation in `<feature-name>-implementation.md`. Once it's finished, go ahead and commit the implementation doc to your repo.

### Iterative Development

Once the AI is finished and you're happy with the implementation, we have more documentation to do! Implementations rarely go exactly to plan, so we have to keep track of what we actually implemented. Ask the AI to document the actual implementation in `<feature-name>-implementation.md`. Once it's finished, go ahead and commit the implementation doc to your repo.

1. **Review the generated code**
2. **Test the implementation**
3. **Document what was actually built** (see [Phase 3: Progress Tracking](#phase-3-progress-tracking))
4. **Commit your progress**
5. **Move to the next step**

## Phase 3: Progress Tracking

This phase runs parallel to implementation and is crucial for maintaining project clarity. You can (and should) ask the AI to do this step for you. It knows what it implemented better than you do!

### Documentation Structure

I organize my documentation in a `documentation/` folder with these files:

- `<feature-name>-plan.md` - The original implementation plan
- `<feature-name>-implementation.md` - What was actually implemented
- `<feature-name>-feature.md` - Final feature documentation ([Phase 4: Evaluation](#phase-4-evaluation))

### Tracking Implementation Changes

Since implementations rarely go exactly to plan:

- Document each step's actual implementation
- Note any deviations from the original plan
- Commit documentation after each major step
- Use feature branches for better organization

You can (and should) ask the AI to do this step for you. It knows what it implemented better than you do!

## Phase 4: Evaluation

Nice job! You just vibe coded a whole feature! Now, it's time to document the feature.

### Creating Feature Documentation

First, make sure that you've filled out each step in the `<feature-name>-implementation.md` file with the actual implementation. Next, we'll prompt the AI to document the feature. Point it towards your `<feature-name>-plan.md` and `<feature-name>-implementation.md` files and ask it to write a separate feature document.

### Why do we create a **third** documentation file?

Because you're probably going to implement some more features, and we both know you don't know how to explain how all the code you just vibe coded works! We create this third file so we can reference it with the AI in the future.

The three-file system serves different purposes:

- **Plan file**: Original roadmap and design decisions
- **Implementation file**: What was actually built and why
- **Feature file**: High-level overview for future reference

## Real-World Benefits

The PIPE Method provides several key benefits:

#### For Future Development

- **Quick AI onboarding**: Reference the feature document to give AI context instantly
- **Efficient debugging**: AI can understand your codebase without full analysis
- **Seamless integration**: New features can integrate with existing AI-coded components

#### For Team Collaboration

- **Knowledge sharing**: Team members can understand your AI-generated code
- **Reduced onboarding time**: New developers can quickly grasp feature implementations
- **Maintainable codebase**: Clear documentation prevents technical debt

#### For Personal Productivity

- **Faster iteration**: AI can build upon previous work without re-learning
- **Better debugging**: Clear documentation helps identify issues quickly
- **Confidence in AI-generated code**: Understanding what was built reduces uncertainty

## Conclusion

The PIPE Method transforms AI-assisted development from chaotic experimentation into a structured, repeatable process. By emphasizing planning, tracking progress, and maintaining comprehensive documentation, you can leverage AI's capabilities while maintaining full control over your codebase.

The key is consistency - follow the method for every feature, and you'll build a well-documented, maintainable codebase that grows more valuable over time.
