`react-blobs-bg` is a small React library for rendering an animated background with with HTML Canvas. It powers the animated background on this portfolio and is designed to be **easy to drop into any React app** while staying **performant and customizable**.

You can find the package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noahpaige/react-blobs-bg) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/noahpaige/react-blobs-bg).

Check out [a live example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/noahpaige/pen/EaKodox) to see it in action.

## Key Features

#### ⚛️ Declarative, prop-driven animation API

Exposed a simple, typed React API where all motion is controlled externally via props, making the component easy to integrate with arbitrary animation systems (hooks, GSAP, Framer Motion, scroll listeners, etc.).

#### 🎨 Performance-focused canvas architecture

Designed a canvas rendering pipeline that uses offscreen rendering, dirty-region computation, batch drawing, and frame-rate limiting to keep animations smooth and efficient.

#### 🧬 Hardware-adaptive quality system

Implemented a hardware probing layer (WebGL renderer info, `deviceMemory`, `hardwareConcurrency`) to classify devices into performance tiers and automatically tune blob count, FPS, and blur.

#### ♻️ Memory- and allocation-aware design

Built object pools and caches for `Path2D`, gradients, and HSL strings, plus systematic cleanup on unmount to avoid leaks and GC churn in long‑lived animations.

#### 🧱 Robust validation and failure modes

Added structured runtime validation for complex props, with clear dev-time logging and safe visual fallbacks instead of noisy crashes when misused.

#### 🧰 TypeScript-first library packaging

Shipped as a TypeScript-first npm package with bundled type definitions, ESM/CJS builds, and a minimal surface area (`AnimatedBackground`/`BlobsBg`, typed helpers) suitable for real-world integration.

#### 🧪 Developer experience and observability

Instrumented the component with structured console output (tables, FPS logs, efficiency metrics) in development mode to help diagnose real-world performance and configuration issues.
